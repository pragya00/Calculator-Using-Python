# Calculator-Using-Python
In this simple Calculator i have used basic GUI using tkinter module.
Code is written in python version 3 . For version less than 3 there must be ssome changes like tkinter module should be in camel case.
I have used two function one for entry of the input and second one for the calculation.
Using grid function buttons are justified. I have used sticky method for shifting buttons accordingly.

If still any confusion please comment or contact.
